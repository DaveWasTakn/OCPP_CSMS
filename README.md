# OCPP Server (WIP!!)

Java-based implementation of an Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) 1.6 compliant CSMS.
Also implements the necessary WebSocket specification (parsing and sending WebSocket frames) manually (for fun).


## Goal

The goal is to develop a CSMS that optimizes EV charging by considering, e.g., solar energy production, solar-battery
state of charge, electricity pricing, as well as time of day, with support for user-defined custom rules.

## Quickstart
